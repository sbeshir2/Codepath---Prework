Protein Tracker App 
 An app idea that I had built, but would like to improve is a protein tracker app. 
 Even though many of these types of apps already exist, the one I had in mind would 
 be much more interactive, for more involvement in the gym community, and easier to
 use then many other tracker apps. As someone who has always wanted to be heavily
 involved in the gym, and wants to be more consious of my body and what I am 
 consuming, I thought this app would be helpful for people that are in the same
 world as me. This would allow you to tracker the amount of protein you are 
 consuming, while also allowing you to input your weight, height and many more 
 requirements you need to obtain your dream weight. You would be able to
 interact with your friends that might have different goals then you, but also 
 interact with new people that have similar goals and a similar body to you to 
 make your journey to getting your dream body more fun. 

## Notes
Some challenges I faced when building the app: 
-I wasn't very familar with XCode, setting up the proper workspace was a bit challenging. 
-I accidentily tried to drag the button to the storyboard instead of the code file which created a segue instead of a IBAction for the button. -Forgot to set the ViewController class in the storyboard whihc broke button connection. 
-Had to learn how to use assistant editor to create the correct IBAactions
